![drawio](../../../_resources/drawio-{_sketch__false}-1)

## Cycles in a graph
![drawio](../../../_resources/drawio-{_sketch__false}-2)

## Terminologies
**Path:** Can contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable. A node cannot appear 2 or more times in a path
![drawio](../../../_resources/drawio-{_sketch__false})

**Degree:(for Undirected)** Total number of incoming & outgoing edges of a node 
![drawio](../../../_resources/drawio-{_sketch__false}-3)
**Note**: Total Degree of a graph = 2 * Total number of Edges

**Degree:(for Directed)** Two types of degree
1. In-degree (Number of incoming edges)
2. Out-degree (Number of outgoing edges)

**Edge Weight:**
