C++03, enums are just integers
```c++
enum apple {green_a, red_a};
enum orange {big_o. small_o};

apple a = green_a;
orange o = big_o;

if (a == o) 
	std::cout << "green apple and big orange are the same" << std::endl;
else 
	std::cout << "green apple and big orange are not the same" << std::endl;
```

C++11
```c++
enum class apple {green, red};
enum class orange {big, small};

apple a = apple::green;
orange o = orange::big;

if (a == o) 
	std::cout << "green apple and big orange are the same" << std::endl;
else 
	std::cout << "green apple and big orange are not the same" << std::endl;

// Compile fails as we have not defined ==(apple, orange) operator
```
