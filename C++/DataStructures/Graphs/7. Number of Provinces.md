[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/#:~:text=A%20province%20is%20a%20group,the%20total%20number%20of%20provinces.)

## Problem

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
void dfs(int node, std::vector<int> adj_ls[], int vis[]) {
    vis[node] = 1;
    for (auto it: adj_ls[node]) {
        if(!vis[it]) {
            dfs(it, adj_ls, vis);
        }
    }
}
public:
int findCircleNum(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& isConnected) {
 const int V = isConnected.size();
 std::vector<int> adj_ls[V];
 for (int i=0; i<V; i++) {
    for (int j=0; j<V; j++) {
        if (isConnected[i][j] == 1 && i != j) {
            adj_ls[i].push_back(j);
            adj_ls[j].push_back(i);
        }
    }
 }
 int vis[V]; int count = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<V; i++) {
        vis[i] = 0;
    }
    for (int i=0; i<V; i++) {
        if (!vis[i]) {
            count++;
            dfs(i, adj_ls, vis);
        }
    }
 return count;
}
};
```

Space Complexity: O(n) (visited array) + O(n) (recursion stack) = ~ O(n) \
Time Complexity : O(n) + O(V + 2E)
