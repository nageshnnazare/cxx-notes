### std::unordered_set

Unsorted, unique

**Properties**
- fastest search/ insert at the any place: O(1) 

```c++
#include <unordered_set>

//Initialization
std::unordered_set<int> us;

// all operation are ideally O(1), worst case O(n) (because of hash collision)
// lower/ upper bound functions don't work
// other functions are same as a set

// Hash table specific APIs
us.load_factor(); // (Total no. of elements)/(Total no. of buckets)

us.bucket(x); // in which bucket element x is stored

us.bucket_count(); // total no. of buckets
```
